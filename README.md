I am a PhD student in the [Compositional Systems and Methods group](https://compose.ioc.ee/) at Tallinn University of Technology under the supervision of [Paweł Sobociński](https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/).

I am working on a categorical formalism for measures of graph complexity like tree width and rank width.
I [have presented](./slides/mwd-syco.html) this work at [SYCO 8](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/8/).
[We have applied this work](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/13464/) to model games played on graphs.

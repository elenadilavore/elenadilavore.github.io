I am a PhD student in the [Compositional Systems and Methods
group](https://compose.ioc.ee/) at Tallinn University of
Technology under the supervision of [Paweł Sobociński](https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/) and [Jules
Hedges](https://julesh.com/).

I am working on a categorical formalism for graphs that [we used](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/13464/) to model games played on graphs.
I also find really exciting when category theory has applications to
engineering subjects such as control systems or Petri nets. 

I am currently working with the [ACT school
2020](https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2020/)
in the [Dialectica categories for Petri nets
project](https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/adjoint-school-act-2020/dialectica-categories-of-petri-nets/).
